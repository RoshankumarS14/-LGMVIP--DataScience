# 🌳 Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm on the Iris Dataset

This project focuses on implementing the decision tree algorithm to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and consists of measurements of different Iris flower species.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model using the decision tree algorithm to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project involves the following steps:

1. 📊 Data Exploration: Analyze the Iris dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions. Visualize the data to gain insights into the characteristics of the different Iris flower species.

2. 🛠️ Data Preprocessing: Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or scaling the features, to prepare the dataset for model training. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. ⚙️ Model Development: Train a decision tree model using the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset. Tune the hyperparameters of the decision tree algorithm to optimize the model's accuracy.

4. 📈 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained decision tree model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the decision tree to interpret the model's decision-making process.
